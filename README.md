# BrainBlitz â€“ Daily Logic Puzzle Game
BrainBlitz is an engaging web-based game project designed to stimulate your mind with fun and challenging puzzles. This project includes four different games that test your problem-solving skills, with a focus on logic, math, and patterns. The games are built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating various JavaScript concepts to create an interactive and responsive user experience.

<h2>Games Included </h2>
<h3>1. Math Game </h3>
In this game, users are given 10 random math questions. They have 60 seconds to answer all the questions. Each correct answer earns the player points. Once all questions are answered or the timer runs out, the game ends, displaying the final score.

A classic word guessing game where the user must guess a hidden word by choosing letters. Each incorrect guess reduces the available attempts. The game challenges memory and vocabulary skills.
